<!--the receiver registered in the manifest file is implicit which means the receiver  class
name or the package name is not explicitly called for an event occurrence instead the system events
that dictate the submission of such event change to the application send it has been registered as intent
filter actions, thing to be noted over here is that the actions registered as a part of intent filter
 dictate the delivery of event change to the applications rather than the receiver being explicitly
 referred through its package name or user ID whatever they call it-->

<!--There are concerns for example the connectivity change action has been deprecated api
level 25 which means if you try to see the connectivity change events Bing listen as a part of the
 broadcast receiver It won't happen it will be always below API level 25 above which they suggest
  to use a work manager for a connectivity change or some listener-->
